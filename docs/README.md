# About Strike

**Strike** is a powerful tool that enables users to **share actionable links** with ease, powered by the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**. With Strike, anyone can interact with **canisters** (smart contracts) directly from social platforms like **Twitter (X)** by sharing a simple link. These links unfurl into interactive **Strike Cards** that allow users to perform predefined actions without the need for complex Web3 development or coding.

Strike makes it easy to integrate blockchain-based functionality into everyday interactions, such as **placing bets**, **transferring ownership**, or **retrieving information** from smart contracts, all with the click of a button. The **Strike Chrome extension** enhances this experience, allowing users to authenticate and securely engage with canisters directly from their browser.

#### Key Features of Strike:

* **Actionable Links**: Share links that allow users to take immediate action (e.g., place a bet, manage an asset) via **Strike Cards**.
* **Powered by ICP**: Strike utilizes the **Internet Computer Protocol** to interact with decentralized applications and smart contracts.
