# About Strike

**Strike** is a platform that allows users to interact with **deployed canisters** (smart contracts) on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)** without the need to write Web3 code. Users can seamlessly interact with predefined canister actions through the simple process of sharing a **Strike URL** and using the **Strike-enabled Chrome extension**. This makes it easy for users to engage with smart contracts directly on supported platforms.

The primary feature of Strike is the ability to execute canister interactions via a **JSON-based metadata file**, which defines actions like "Get Owner" or "Set Owner" without requiring users to develop custom Web3 interfaces. Strike currently supports interaction on **Twitter (X)**, where users can share Strike URLs, and the platform renders the necessary action components for interaction.
