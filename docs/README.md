# About Strike

**Strike** is a decentralized tool built on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**, designed to facilitate seamless interactions with **canisters** (smart contracts) through a simple and intuitive user interface. Strike enables users to interact with canisters by unfurling URLs across various platforms, such as **Twitter (X)**, and performing predefined actions, such as retrieving or updating data, without the need for complex Web3 coding or backend development.

At its core, Strike simplifies how users and developers engage with blockchain technology, allowing actions to be executed directly from a URL through a **Chrome extension**.&#x20;
