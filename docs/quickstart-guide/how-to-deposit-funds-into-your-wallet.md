Open your external wallet or exchange where your funds are currently stored. Paste the copied wallet address or scan the QR code to set up the transfer. Enter the amount you wish to deposit.

### **Step 4: Confirm Deposit Details**

Note the small deposit fee, which will be deducted from the amount you send.

&#x20;The deposit process involves a static fee of 0.000001 BTC. This fee is associated with the conversion costs when transferring BTC to Chain Key Bitcoin (ckBTC) on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) network.

Confirm the transaction in your external wallet. The transfer may take some time to process, depending on the network traffic and confirmations required by the blockchain.

### **Step 5: Update and Verify Balance**

Once the transfer have been processed, return to the BetBTC wallet dashboard and click ‘Update balance’ to refresh your account balance. Ensure that the deposited funds reflect in your BetBTC wallet under ‘Balance’.
