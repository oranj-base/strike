# How to Earn Referral Points

BetBTC rewards you for growing our community. Our referral program lets you earn points by inviting friends and family to join the platform. It's simple to start and can lead to significant rewards.

Here are the steps to earn your referal points:

### Step 1: Access Your Referral Code

Begin by signing into your account at [BetBTC.win](https://www.betbtc.win). Once logged in, go to your account settings. Find the section labeled **"Referral code"** in the settings. Here youâ€™ll see a unique URL which is your personalized referral link.

### Step 3:  Tracking Your Points

After sharing your referral code, each successful referral earns you 100 points. This occurs when a new user signs up with your unique referral link.

Regularly check the referral section to monitor how many points you have earned. Use the leaderboard to gauge your performance against other referrers.&#x20;
