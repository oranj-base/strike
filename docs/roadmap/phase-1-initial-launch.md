## Phase 1: Initial Launch

**Objective**: Establish a secure and functional base for the BetBTC platform, integrating Rune technology for unique digital asset identification and incentivizing early users through strategic airdrops.

Here are the Key Activities in Phase 1:

### **Market Creation**

* **Curated Markets by BetBTC Team**: Initially, all markets on BetBTC will be created and managed by the platform's team. This control allows for:
  * Ensuring market integrity and stability.
  * Testing various market structures and dynamics.
  * Fine-tuning the market creation process based on real-user interactions.

### **Betting Mechanism**

* **Use of ckBTC for Transactions**: Participants will place bets using ckBTC, which ensures that all transactions are processed within the secure framework of the blockchain.
* **Outcome-Based Payouts**: Payouts are directly tied to the outcomes of the events. The accuracy of these payouts is critical and will be closely monitored to guarantee fairness and transparency.

### **Runes Token Integration**

* **Airdrop to Engage Early Users**: Introduction of Runes tokens through an airdrop to reward early adopters
* **Governance and Voting Rights**: Runes holders may also participate in the governance of the platform. This includes voting on various proposals related to platform updates, feature enhancements, and policy changes, promoting a decentralized governance structure that aligns with the ethos of blockchain technology.

## Phase 1.5: Introduce "Blinks" (Coming Soon)

**Objective**: To enhance the platform's interactivity and engagement by allowing betting integration on existing platforms.

* **Platform Integration**: Implement "Blinks", a feature that allows seamless betting directly on platforms like X, potentially referring to a social media or another third-party platform.
* **User Experience**: Aim to enhance user experience and engagement by making the betting process more integrated and less intrusive, encouraging frequent use and interaction.
