You earn points when someone signs up using your referral link. For each successful referral, you receive 100 points.

You can track your earned points and referral activity in the "Activity" section under "Rewards." These points can contribute to your standing on the referral leaderboard, offering additional incentives for active participation.

### **3. Principals Management**

Principals refer to your unique identity on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Managing principals allows you to securely interact with smart contracts and other decentralized features on the platform.

In the Settings, there are "Connect" buttons allowing you to link your principals to your BetBTC account. You can connect using either the **Internet Identiy** or **NFID**, which are essential for secure authentication and transaction management.
