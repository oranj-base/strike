# Actions

The **JSON file** used in Strike is a key component for defining actions and interactions with canisters on the Internet Computer. This JSON file contains metadata that defines the structure, appearance, and functionality of the Strike component when a user interacts with a canister via a shared URL (such as through Twitter).&#x20;

Below is a detailed breakdown of the JSON format, followed by an explanation of the image provided.
