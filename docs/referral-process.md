# Referral Process

BetBTC's referral program is designed to incentivize user growth and active participation by rewarding existing users for successfully inviting new members to the platform. This program leverages a points-based system to allocate rewards from the Community Treasury, encouraging both the acquisition of new users and their active engagement in betting activities. Points System

### Points System

#### 1. Referral Points

* **Successful Referral**: A referral is deemed successful when the referred user completes their first transaction or places their first bet on the platform.
* **Points Awarded**: Each successful referral earns the referring user a predetermined number of points. For instance, 100 points might be awarded per successful referral.

#### 2. Activity Points

* **Betting Activity**: Points are granted based on the total amount wagered by the referred user. For example, 1 point could be awarded for every $10 wagered in ckBTC.
* **Liquidity Provision**: Additional points are awarded based on the amount of ckBTC provided to liquidity pools by the referred users, enhancing the platform's financial ecosystem.

#### 3. Bonus Points

* **Milestone Referrals**: Bonus points are awarded for reaching specific referral milestones, such as:
  * 2,500 points for the 50th referral.
  * 5,000 points for the 100th referral.
* **High Activity Users**: Extra points are granted to referred users who achieve certain activity thresholds, such as wagering or providing a total of $1000 ckBTC.

### Rewards Distribution

#### Monthly Distribution

* **Points Tally**: Points are tallied at the end of each month, with rewards distributed accordingly.
* **Reward Calculation**: The total monthly reward pool from the Community Treasury is divided proportionally based on the points each user has accumulated.
* **Transparency and Fairness**: A public leaderboard will be available to display the top referrers and their points, ensuring transparency and fairness in the distribution process.

### Example Breakdown

Assume a monthly reward pool of 1,000,000 Tokens and the following user activity:

* **User A** accumulates 1,650 points through referrals, betting activity, and milestones.
* **User B** gathers 650 points from referrals and liquidity provision.
* **User C** earns 140 points from minimal referrals and activity.

#### Rewards Calculation

* **User A**: (1,650 / 2,440 total points) \* 1,000,000 Tokens = 676,229 Tokens
* **User B**: (650 / 2,440 total points) \* 1,000,000 Tokens = 266,393 Tokens
* **User C**: (140 / 2,440 total points) \* 1,000,000 Tokens = 57,377 Tokens

This comprehensive structure ensures that active and successful referrers are rewarded proportionately, fostering a vibrant and growing community on the BETBTC platform.
